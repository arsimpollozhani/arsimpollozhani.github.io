            <h2>My Biography</h2>
            <p>My name is Arsim Pollozhani, and I was born in Ohrid, North Macedonia, a beautiful city cradled by the shores of Lake Ohrid, famous for its deep history and stunning scenery. I'm currently studying in Skopje at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering, where I’m chasing my dreams as a first-year Software Engineering student.
                Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by computers and love tackling problems, which is why I chose to dive into software development. As a student, I’m excited to learn the ins and outs of programming and hope to build innovative solutions that can make a difference. Living in Ohrid, I find inspiration in the city’s peaceful landscapes and rich culture while balancing my studies with its vibrant energy.
                As I kick off this journey in software engineering, I’m driven to grow and contribute to the tech world, carrying with me the unique perspective.
