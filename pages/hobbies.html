                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I’m passionate about programming, spending hours coding and experimenting with new projects.
                    As a software engineering student, I love the thrill of solving problems and creating
                    something functional from scratch, constantly growing my skills in this ever-evolving field.

                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>Reading is a big part of my life, and I’m drawn to books that spark curiosity and reflection.
                    I dive into physics books to explore the wonders of the universe and enjoy dystopian novels by
                    authors like George Orwell and other authors like
                    Ismail Kadare, and Erich Maria Remarque, whose stories challenge my views on society and human
                    nature.

                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>Football is my go-to for staying active and connecting with others. I thrive on the energy of the
                    game,
                    enjoying the teamwork, strategy, and adrenaline that come with every match.

                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>Living in Ohrid, I take full advantage of the city’s stunning natural surroundings by hiking its
                    trails. Exploring the rugged landscapes and soaking in breathtaking views of Lake Ohrid refreshes me
                    and fuels my appreciation for my hometown’s beauty.
